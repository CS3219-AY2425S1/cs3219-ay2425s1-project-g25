# CS3219 Project (PeerPrep) - AY2425S1
## Group: G25

### Overview
This project follows a microservices architecture with the following services:
1. **Frontend** - Port `3000`
2. **User Service** - Port `3001`
3. **Question Service** - Port `3002` 
4. **Matching Service** - Port `3003`
5. **Collaboration Service** - Port `3004`
6. **MongoDB** - Port `27017` (Database)
7. **Nginx API Gateway** - Port `80`
8. **Redis** - Port `6379`
9. **Zookeeper** - Port `2181`
10. **Kafka** - Port `9092`, Port `29092`
11. **Chat Service** (Located in addon/chat)

### Setting up the Project
Copy and paste the .env.example files in each service. Rename them as .env files.
Files to do this in:
1. ./
2. /frontend
3. /backend/user-service
4. /backend/question-service
5. /backend/matching-service
6. /backend/collaboration-service

Then, run `node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(32).toString('hex'))"` twice to generate
your 2 JWT token secrets. For the first one, paste it into the JWT_ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET variable of
the .env files in question-service and user-service. Then, copy the second into the
JWT_REFRESH_TOKEN_SECRET of the .env file in user-service. 

Further note: The DB_CLOUD_URI .env variable in user-service doesn't need to be filled in. A local
database will be created in the mongoDB service. 

Consult the readme files in each service if there are further configurations needed.

### Running the Project

To run the main services, execute the following command in the root directory:

`docker-compose up --build`

To run the chat service, navigate to the addon/chat directory and run:

`docker-compose up --build`

Once the containers are up:
- Frontend: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
- User Service: [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001)
- Question Service: [http://localhost:3002](http://localhost:3002)
- Matching Service: [http://localhost:3003](http://localhost:3003)
- Collaboration Service: [http://localhost:3004](http://localhost:3004)
- MongoDB: [http://localhost:27017](http://localhost:27017)
- Nginx API Gateway: [http://localhost:80](http://localhost:80)
- Redis: [http://localhost:6379](http://localhost:6379)
- Zookeeper: [http://localhost:2181](http://localhost:2181)
- Kafka: [http://localhost:9092](http://localhost:9092)
- Chat Service: Available through the main application

Note that even after docker says that everything is up and running, there is a risk that they aren't when you load the frontend. Wait for the frontend logs to show up in the docker logs.
In this event, wait for about a minute before trying again. If that still doesn't work and there are network errors, try
rebuilding the services by running `docker-compose up --build` again.

### MongoDB Configuration

- MongoDB runs on port `27017` inside a container named `peerprep-mongo-container`.
- It is initialized with:
  - **Username**: `admin`
  - **Password**: `password`
- Data is persisted in the `./data/db` directory, and the `init-mongo.js` script initializes the database on startup.

### Nginx API Gateway

- Nginx runs on port `80` and acts as the API gateway for routing requests to the respective services.
